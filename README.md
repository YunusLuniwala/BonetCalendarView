Features
========

## Date Picker


## Quickly navigate through months
Say the calendar is displaying September 2013 but for some reason you want to select November 2015. Do you really want to press next 26 times? Not here. Tap the title, and the caelndar will let you choose which month you want. From 26 presses to 4! Cool huh?


## Easy to customize
This calendar was built so that you can easily implement your own view. We provide simple list and grid displays, but we know that you want the calendar to follow your app look and feel.
